A primer to all the things Panopticon Project looks at.

## How do APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) operate?

[Like government agencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP2J9aYM6Oo) according to [The Grugq](https://twitter.com/thegrugq). they are groups, often employed by a government, that are directed to hack into organisations and the devices of individuals that the government they work for deem to hold useful intelligence.

They leverage [infrastucture](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/forget-apts-lets-talk-about-advanced-persistent-infrastructure/a/d-id/1330427) like [command and control servers (C&C or C2 servers)](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/command-and-control-server-CC-server) to launch [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) from. [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) of malicious servers are one of the things P2 looks for to define the infrastructure being used by malicious parties.

[Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) is often used by malicious parties to trick the recipient into clicking a link, which connects your computer to a C&C server, to download malware. Malware can do all sorts of nasty things, such as [encrypt sections of a computers operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware), [rendering it unusbale and destroying all the information it contains](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/). Malware can [steal credit card data](https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/10/credit-card-stealer-investigation-uncovers-malware-ring.html). Malware can cause [blackouts](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/). Blackouts caused by malware aren't common but they have [happened](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/). 

APTs have done all of this in the past, but the main goal of an APT, usually, is not to destroy things or steal money, it is to gather intelligence. The malware you will often see in connection with APTs are [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware/), [infostealers](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2000-122016-0558-99) and Remote Access Trojans, commonly known as [RATs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_access_trojan).

As well as targeting [individuals](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzyg3a/smartphone-malware-nso-group-amnesty-international-saudi-arabia) that can lead to harm or even death if sensitive information, like someone's location, is passed to the wrong parties, APTs can be used by governments to sway a rival country's [elections](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/07/20/microsoft_fancy_bear_warning/) or [cripple their critical infrastructure](https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hacking-teams-infrastructure/). 

## Corporate surveillance, digital tracking, big data & privacy

Corporations collect data about people to [build profiles that they then sell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ABaGEWjFIg). These profiles are valuable as information is often easy to collect, providing a very cheap revenue stream, and profiles inform how [advertising is targeted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/business/how-targeted-advertising-works/412/?noredirect=on). 

We live in a [surveillance economy](https://medium.com/the-graph/algorithms-dictators-the-surveillance-economy-e89139d42214) 

## Social media platforms, inclusion and exclusion online
